title: Notes for talk on "Peer review and preprint policies are unclear at most major journals"

# Introduction
Title of preprint might seem bold: with peer review as centerpiece of
scientific publishing, would expect to have clear policies at least on that. 
In the next 20 minutes will report on a study I conducted together with a group
of colleagues which found that publishing policies are indeed quite unclear.

Imagine a graduate student that has just written a paper and want's to publish
it somewhere. Don't need too much imagination, that grad student could in fact 
be me. I haven't published a substantial paper yet, don't know the journals or
the norms of this field I'm starting to work in. So naturally author guidelines 
and anything the journal has on their website are important source of 
information for what I can expect, and what is expected of me. I've heard of 
cool new things like preprints that promise rapid dissemination of your research
and things like open peer review, where I at least know the name of reviewer #2
who finds all the weak aspects of my paper.

But of course, I don't know the journals, so I don't know whether posting a 
preprint will prohibit me from submitting to important journals. I'd have to
look it up, and I'd very much hope that I can find this information.

I could also be on the other end of peer review. My supervisor gets asked to 
write a review of a manuscript and want's to involve me. First reaction: great, 
let's see how this actually works. But does the journal allow this? Will my
contribution be acknowledged anywhere when I write most of the review?

I think we can all agree, that guidance on these issues is important. Since many
belief this to be an area where there is still a lot of room for improvement,
we wanted to take a closer look and assess the situation.


# Data
Selected journals from GSM. Took top 100 and top 20 per discipline. 
Articles are ranked by h5-index: "is the largest number h such that h articles 
published in [the last 5 complete years] have at least h citations each".

This has limitations:

- slight bias towards health & medicine
- only covers journals in English
- sample cannot be taken to be representative of whole publishing landscape
- rather a pragmatic view on major and well-known journals

We created data collection instrument with questions and then searched for this
information on the journal website. Each journal was searched by two assessors,
then a third round tried to resolve any conflicts.

Data analysis involved further recoding and collapsing of categories so we 
wouldn't be looking at single journals. We did not preregister those steps, so
the whole analysis is clearly exploratory in its nature.


# Policy clarity
Discuss figures:

- overall clarity
- clarity MCA
- clarity per discipline and publisher

# Peer review
Overall:

- Unsure: 54 out of 171 journals (31.6%) 
- Single blind: 29.8% 
- Double blind 26.9%

nature journals: can choose single or double blind (most of category other)


# Open peer review
Discuss figure


# Co-reviewing
- Explain again what co-reviewing is.
- Discuss figure

We also looked at the actual content of the policies, found that the role of 
editor is strong: in most cases there is no clear yes or no whether you can
co-review, you have to first ask the editor for permission -> as a grad student
you are not going to do this.

# Posting preprints
- Allow some form: 120 out of 171 journals (70.2%)
- Allow before peer review: 39.2% of the total sample 
- No policy: 22.8% 

discuss figure

# Citing preprints
No policy (57.3%) or unclear policy (15.2%) are the most common ones.

discuss figure: clear difference between STEM and SSH

# Conclusions
Summing up: we found that there is a lack of clear guidance on issues of peer
review and preprinting.

Potential reasons for this lack:

- Open research practices are not equally common per field. Preprints well known
in physics, but only recently in SSH. If preprints (or something else) plays no
role, of course few journals will have a policy on it.
- Contrary explanation could be, that given practice is so common that no policy
is needed. In certain fields type of peer review is very uniform: SSH double
blind, STEM commonly single blind. If it is known, how this is done in a field,
maybe there is no need to explicitly mention it in any author guidelines.


Questions:

- could you think of other explanations for this lack of clarity?
- Is this actually a problem? As a sociologist inclined to say: that's how it is
right now, let's see what scientists and journals/editors do or don't do about 
  it.
